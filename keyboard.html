                    The keyboard is a computer peripheral hardware component that allows the user to enter data
                    (letters, numbers and special characters) into its central unit by pressing some keys. The most used
                    keyboards worldwide are the QWERTY type.</p>
                <p>
                <h1><b>Alphanumeric keypad</b></h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The most important group is the one that takes up most of the keyboard; it contains keys for letters
                    (Q, W, E, etc.), numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and symbols (@, #, etc.), as well as special keys (<i>Enter
                        </ i>, <i>Shift</i>, <i>Control</i>, <i>Alt</i>, etc.) whose functionality varies depending on
                        the program used.
                </p>
                <h1><b>Function key block</b></h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Above the main group is a row of keys called "functional" (F1, F2, F3, etc.), whose role is to
                    directly launch commands for the computer, commands that are different depending on the software we
                    use at that moment. They are used a lot in games, but there are also other software that use them.
                </p>
                <h1><b>Cursor Control Keypad*</b></h1>


                <p class="paragraph">
                    To the right of the main group is a group divided into several (usually three) subgroups and
                    containing keys used mainly for screen navigation (the keys with arrows drawn on them, the <i>Page
                        Up</i> or <i>Page Down</i>, etc.), but also some keys with special functions, such as the
                    <i>Delete</i> or <i>Print Screen</i> key.
                </p>
                <h1><b>Number pad*</b></h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    At the right end of the keyboard there is usually a group of keys that are used especially for
                    writing numbers and performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), the keys being
                    placed very conveniently for working with the right hand. Some of the keys in this last group have a
                    double functionality, they can also be used for navigation.
                </p>
                <p><small>*Often on laptops, these key blocks are missing to facilitate portability.</small>
