                <p class="paragraph" style="top: 10vh;">The mouse is one of the most important peripheral devices for
                    inputting commands of the modern computer. Usually the mouse is a small object equipped with one or
                    more keys, shaped so that it can be easily grasped and manipulated by hand. Its operating principle
                    is based on the recognition by the computer of its movement relative to the flat surface on which it
                    is placed and moved.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The main movement translation techniques use mechanical, optical and inertial
                    sensors:</p>

                    <h1>Mechanical mice</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">A variant of the mouse, invented in the early 1970s by engineer Bill English of
                        the Xerox PARC company, replaced the external wheels with a single ball that could move in any
                        direction. The movement of the ball, in turn, was detected by two perpendicular wheels that were
                        inside the mouse. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball, and was the main
                        form used with personal computers in the 1980s and 1990s. The group at Xerox PARC settled on the
                        modern technique of using both hands to type on a <u>QWERTY</u> keyboard, and the mouse was used
                        only when needed.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Modern mice were born at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under
                        the inspiration of Professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and the hands of engineer and watchmaker André
                        Guignard. An outgrowth of EPFL, the company Logitech launched the first popular mouse.</p>

                    <h1>Optical mice</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">An optical mouse uses a light-emitting diode and a photodiode to detect
                        movement on the surface of a mousepad, without moving parts like a mechanical mouse.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Early optical mice, such as those invented by Steve Kirsch of Mouse Systems
                        Corporation, could only be used on a special metal surface: a mousepad that had a fine grid of
                        blue and gray lines printed on it. As computing power became cheaper, it became possible to
                        integrate image processing ICs into the mouse. This advantage allowed mice to detect movement on
                        a wide variety of surfaces.</p>

                    <h1>Tactile mice</h1>
                </div>

                <p class="paragraph">In 2000, Logitech introduced the <i>"touch mouse"</i>, which contained an actuator
                    that made the mouse vibrate. A haptic feedback ast, for example: to give feedback when the edge of a
                    window was passed.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">In the fall of 2009, Apple introduced the <i>"Magic Mouse"</i> model. It looks like
                    a regular mouse but it doesn't have to be moved and has no keys or wheel, reacting to certain finger
                    movements directly on its upper surface.</p>

                <h1>Unconventional mice</h1>

                <p class="paragraph">Apart from the usual mice, which are operated by hand, there are other types of
                    mice. They help those who have a disability, those who have sustained injuries from excessive mouse
                    use, or those who cannot use conventional designs. Some of these are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Trackball — the user moves a ball mounted on a fixed base</li>
                    <li>Minimouse — a small mouse, about the size of an egg, which is optimized for portability (very
                        often used together with laptops)</li>
                    <li>Camera mouse — a camera tracks the movements of the user's head and moves the cursor on the
                        screen accordingly. Another variation tracks a dot on a person's head and moves the cursor
                        accordingly. It is more accurate than the previous</li>
                    <li>Palm mouse — is held in the palm and is operated by only two buttons; the movements on the
                        screen correspond to a very fine touch, and the pressure determines the movement speed</li>
                    <li>Foot mouse — a mouse variant for those who don't want or can't use their hands or head</li>
                    <li>Joy-mouse — a combination of a joystick and a mouse, the joy-mouse is held vertically like a
                        joystick, but is moved like a normal mouse. Usually, a button</li> can be pressed with the thumb
                </ul>
                </p>
